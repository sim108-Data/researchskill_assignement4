## Assignement 4 : Visualisation of rush hours for the city of Montréal

This repository contains the following files :
* assignement4.py : the python file containing the code 
* export_trajets.csv : the csv containing the data 
* week.jpg and weekend.jpg : which represents the two graphs that you should get after compiling the code


## Description

This code helps to model the traffic congestion for the city of in Montréal for the period of September 2017 to October 2017. The output of the code shows that we have specific rushhours during the week and none during the weekend.
Warning : Due to the big amonth of data, the code take 5-7 minutes to run in order to make both graphs.

## Getting Started

First, you will need to have " git " install in your computer to be able to clone the repository in your computer. You will also need to have python install. If this is not the case you can download it from here : https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

### Dependencies and Installing

The code is using two Python libraries : Pandas to analyze data and Matplotlib to visualise the output of the analysis 

If you are completely new to this two libriries. The easiest way to get them is to download "anaconda" to be able to use "conda" command in your terminal. Here is the link : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html . Those two can also be download in some other way. More information are provided on their website : https://pypi.org/project/pandas/

If you are using anaconda, you can simply copy those codelines on your terminal.

* pandas : 
```
conda install -c anaconda pandas
```

* matplotlib :

```
conda install matplotlib
```

### Executing program

To execute the program you need to follow the step describe below:
* clone the repository 
* get the Python librairies
* enter in the repository with this command (Windows) or equivalent codeline for Mac and Linux
```
cd researchskill_assignement4
```
* and then run the file assignement4.py as follow:
```
python assignement4.py
```
* After 5-6 min, two files should have been save as 'week.jpg' and 'weekend.jpg'
