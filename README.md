This repository contains the following files :
* assignement4.py : the python file containing the code 
* export_trajets.csv : the csv containing the data 
* week.jpg and weekend.jpg : which represents the two graphs that you should get after compiling the code


## Description

This code helps to model the traffic congestion for the city of in Montr√©al for the period of September 2017 to October 2017.
Warning : Due to the big amonth of data, the code take 5 minutes to run in order to make both graphs.

You should also download "anaconda" to get further needed librairies. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

### Dependencies and Installing

To be able to run the code you will need to have some specific librairies that can be download on putting those codelines on the terminal after downloading anaconda. 
If you are more familiar with pip you can also use "pip install".

* pandas : 
```
conda install -c anaconda pandas
